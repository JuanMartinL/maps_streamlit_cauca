Clean kitchen and hot showers.,1.0,"My motorbike got stolen directly in front of the hostel at bright daylight, even though i was told it’s okay to park it there for a few hours as long as I later park it inside (didn’t want to block the hallway). The woman and staff - excluding the manager, see below - were very nice. But at the time of the theft the lady didn’t have data on her phone nor was there a landline. Finally managed to get the number of the Police who arrived 1 hour later and didn’t do much.

I was able to buy the motorbike back from the thieves a few days later… 🤨  >>The woman in the other review got it wrong, the negotiations were NOT done through  this hostel, as I checked out the next day and went to a hostel that seemed to have a better understanding of helping me with this matter.

Without the stolen motorbike I would have given 4 stars, nice little place, good beds. But this info given was dangerously careless. Later, by other people, I was later told this area has a very high crime rate, so stuff gets stolen there all the time. Met some Italians who got their earphones stolen the same day in a cafe in the same area.

**Edit, as reply to the owners reply:
1. I didn’t have any bags on the bike, they were all in my room. The installed case on my bike, yes. But that can’t be removed.
2. Saying that I left my bags on the bike highlights that you weren’t there yourself. If you weren’t there all the time, how can you call me a liar &  be so sure what the woman said and didn’t say?
3. If she had told me that it COULD be dangerous and there is a chance the bike can get stolen, I would have put the bike inside, which I had planned for when it was getting dark anyway, I didn’t want to block the reception with my bike in front of it
4. This guy has an extremely rude way of replying to negative reviews, check his other replies. Not a good tactic to receive more customers.
5. My motorbike was stolen. Do you want to argue about that too? I can give you the police report. Also, many people told me this is stuff happens a lot on this area. Had I known this, do you really think I would have left it outside? Correct, I wouldn’t have.
6. I live in Colombia for many years, also many years in Cali, which has a reputation of being very dangerous. I am not stupid and have travelled the world. I am street smart. Something like this would have NOT happened in Cali, not on broad daylight. Simple as that.

***Edit 2, again, read the other reactions of the manager to other critical reviews, zero ability to reflect and just lashes out. Poor employees. I have nothing more to say.

***Edit 3, there were videos? Why didn’t you tell that to the police when they were trying to find the thief. Super sketchy. Super rude. „Lying“? Daydreaming? It was 3 in the afternoon and I left it outside for 1 hour, your employee told me that it is okay to leave it there. Lying, again? Well, prove it! Sketchy dude. Don’t stay here!",Santa Teresa

Every member of the team was incredibly courteous and kind, always going above and beyond to ensure my stay was perfect. Their genuine warmth and attentiveness made me feel welcome and well-cared for throughout my visit.

What I didn't like is that the room I stayed in doesn't have windows which isn't the best for the smell... As well, there is only ONE bathroom (shower and toilet together) for at least 10 people so you always need to queue to enter (and we were in low season) As well, the toilet seat and the head of the shower are broken, the reception knows about it but look like they do not mind. Also the receptionists do not care about their job ! They have no information about anything and just stay at their desk all day long...

- The staff was friendly, especially Sebastián and David.
- The room and the bathroom were large and clean.
- The location was pretty good as well.
- There is a cool “chill out” area on the last floor was a ping-pong table, and a bluetooth speaker!

Here are some negative points:
- The breakfast is really not enough, only one egg and a small piece of bread, that’s it.
- The room was a big empty, in the sense that there is not even a chair or a table to put your things.
- The confusion between “Les Balcons Hostel” and “Hotel Los Balcones” in Popayán is terrible.

Clean kitchen and hot showers.,1.0,"My motorbike got stolen directly in front of the hostel at bright daylight, even though i was told it’s okay to park it there for a few hours as long as I later park it inside (didn’t want to block the hallway). The woman and staff - excluding the manager, see below - were very nice. But at the time of the theft the lady didn’t have data on her phone nor was there a landline. Finally managed to get the number of the Police who arrived 1 hour later and didn’t do much.

I was able to buy the motorbike back from the thieves a few days later… 🤨  >>The woman in the other review got it wrong, the negotiations were NOT done through  this hostel, as I checked out the next day and went to a hostel that seemed to have a better understanding of helping me with this matter.

Without the stolen motorbike I would have given 4 stars, nice little place, good beds. But this info given was dangerously careless. Later, by other people, I was later told this area has a very high crime rate, so stuff gets stolen there all the time. Met some Italians who got their earphones stolen the same day in a cafe in the same area.

**Edit, as reply to the owners reply:
1. I didn’t have any bags on the bike, they were all in my room. The installed case on my bike, yes. But that can’t be removed.
2. Saying that I left my bags on the bike highlights that you weren’t there yourself. If you weren’t there all the time, how can you call me a liar &  be so sure what the woman said and didn’t say?
3. If she had told me that it COULD be dangerous and there is a chance the bike can get stolen, I would have put the bike inside, which I had planned for when it was getting dark anyway, I didn’t want to block the reception with my bike in front of it
4. This guy has an extremely rude way of replying to negative reviews, check his other replies. Not a good tactic to receive more customers.
5. My motorbike was stolen. Do you want to argue about that too? I can give you the police report. Also, many people told me this is stuff happens a lot on this area. Had I known this, do you really think I would have left it outside? Correct, I wouldn’t have.
6. I live in Colombia for many years, also many years in Cali, which has a reputation of being very dangerous. I am not stupid and have travelled the world. I am street smart. Something like this would have NOT happened in Cali, not on broad daylight. Simple as that.

***Edit 2, again, read the other reactions of the manager to other critical reviews, zero ability to reflect and just lashes out. Poor employees. I have nothing more to say.

***Edit 3, there were videos? Why didn’t you tell that to the police when they were trying to find the thief. Super sketchy. Super rude. „Lying“? Daydreaming? It was 3 in the afternoon and I left it outside for 1 hour, your employee told me that it is okay to leave it there. Lying, again? Well, prove it! Sketchy dude. Don’t stay here!",Santa Teresa

Make sure you get a room overlooking the square !",1.0,"Came to the restaurant of Camino Real after reading about it in Lonely Planet and receiving a Rec from a Colombian friend in Cali.

I’m short: incredibly Disappointing! The food wasn’t good, the service wasn’t good, and the ambiance was stuffy and outdated.

The restaurant was empty except for three tables at 7:30pm on a Wednesday. The decor is going for a traditional/antique vibe with tons of interesting eclectic pieces serving as decorations (old irons, old posters, etc) but with the emptiness and stuffiness of the staff, it didn’t feel charming, but instead fell flat and outdated.

We ordered two different menus, each with a price of 60,000 COP. This was my most expensive meal in my three weeks in Colombia, and the worst. My courses included: the shrimp ravioli, asparagus salad, palate cleansing lulo “sherbet”, beef in wine sauce, cheese plate, and apple dessert.

I don’t eat much seafood, but the ravioli were actually made from the shrimp being butterflies open and stuffed with mint/onion and the plate was smothered with a butter sauce. The shrimp tasted tough and over cooked and I couldn’t taste anything but butter. The asparagus salad was a bed of ice berg, pickled white asparagus and an acidic unknown dressing. I do not like pickled asparagus or white asparagus very much, so it was a miss for me and flavorless. My dining partner’s second course was a trout that tasted very fishy and was underwhelming as well. My course didn’t seem up to par with her “main dish” next course, even though her tasting menu was the same price. The beef with wine sauce was nice, though the meat was a bit undercooked. I ordered medium rAre, but my meat was quite red throughout. The same was true for the pepper steak dish ordered by my dining companion. The steak was served with a side salad - the same iceberg lettuce, acidic unknown dressing, mango and green beans. Bland and boring. The other side was a small boiled potato with some herbs on top. Again, bland and boring.

Our desserts were no less disappointing. My dining companion ordered the Eduardo santos, a traditional dessert made with condensed milk and various fruits. It came out frozen like a Mexican-style popsicle and was difficult to eat, but not bad. The apple dessert I ordered was not only disgustingly sweet (it is made with puff pastries from the region that are coated intensely in sugar), but the apples that came on top didn’t even have the skin cut off and were flavored with a cinnamon that tasted like red hots. Not what you want in a dessert!

The restaurant didn’t offer us a drink
Menú - the waiter said it “isn’t complete”. They also don’t serve wine by the glass. At a restaurant that has won culinary awards?! Strange.

Finally, our waiter was attentive, but never once asked us if we were enjoying our meal or how the food was. Very strange since he was peering at us in the empty restaurant for the majority of our meal.

Overall, I recommend you don’t waste your money here. You can eat so much better in Colombia and for much cheaper. There’s a reason they won their culinary awards 30 years ago. Avoid!",Centro

From the moment I walked in, I was drawn to the variety of desserts and sweets offered at this establishment.

The first thing that caught my attention was the quality and presentation of the desserts. Carmelita's Shop offers a wide variety of options, from traditional Colombian desserts like tres leches and flan, to more innovative and creative options like fruit cheesecake and chocolate brownie. I liked the way the desserts are presented, with an elegant and attractive decoration that makes it hard to resist trying them.

But what really impressed me was the salpicón. Carmelita's Shop offers a salpicón that is truly delicious and authentic. The mix of fresh fruits, such as pineapple, mango, and papaya, with a touch of sugar and lemon, is perfect. I liked the way the salpicón is served, in a large, cool bowl, with a dollop of sour cream on the side. It's a perfect dessert for any time of year, and it's ideal for satisfying a craving for something sweet and refreshing.

The service at La Tienda de Carmelita is also very good. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they go out of their way to make customers feel comfortable and satisfied. I liked the way they greeted me with a smile and offered me a sample of the desserts so I could choose the one I liked best.

In short, La Tienda de Carmelita in Popayán is a place I highly recommend for anyone looking for a delicious and authentic dessert. The salpicón is especially recommended, and it's a dessert you can't miss. The quality of the desserts, the presentation, and the service at La Tienda de Carmelita make it a must-try for any sweets lover.

Rating: 5/5 stars

Recommendation: Don't miss the opportunity to try the salpicón at La Tienda de Carmelita. It's a delicious and refreshing dessert that will leave you wanting more. It's also recommended to order a coffee or tea to accompany your dessert, as the shop offers a variety of hot and cold beverage options.",4.0,"It is a store where you can find the most typical things from Popayán: cocadas, pipian tamales, cabbage, Eduardo Santos dessert, etc. They have excellent service.

I wanted to enjoy Christmas dinner with my family without having to cook, and then, searching online, I found this catering company with very good reviews.
But everything was a disaster. First, they told me there would be a different menu for December than the one they'd already sent me. Then, in December, they confirmed it wouldn't change. So, my family and I chose some appetizers and main courses. When we went there to make arrangements, they said they only had two appetizers available, which we ended up not ordering. We ordered a 3-meat roll, a chicken roll, potato salad, and fruit salad. First, it was completely disorganized. A catering company normally delivers food, but they didn't. A catering company provides containers for the food, and no, you had to bring your own container to take your order. We arrived to pick up the food and had to wait an hour because the fruit salad was just being prepared.
In short, the beef and chicken rolls were so ground up that you couldn't even tell what kind of meat they were made of, and they didn't smell that good. The potato salad was raw potatoes, with a little corn, parsley, and a few pieces of the cheapest sausage possible, without mayonnaise or any other sauce. The fruit salad was sour and we had to throw it away.
I honestly wouldn't recommend anyone ordering from this catering company. 0 out of 10.",1.0,"The food was very good, but I ordered something the next day and I went the next day and there was none.
Also, there is a dog in a restaurant, Seve, there is no hygiene, and it is also slow.",1.0,"I do not recommend it, they do not comply with the estimated delivery times, we ordered a stuffed chicken for a specific time and when we went to claim it they made us wait more than an hour at the site and they did not deliver it.",1.0,"They don't meet the estimated delivery time, they delay the order significantly, so you have to go elsewhere for the service.",1.0,"Very bad service, you call and they hang up on you, you call back and the secretary is not there and you go in person to be told that there is no product.",Santa Teresa

It dates back to the 17th century and is located in the oldest neighborhood of Popayán, the La Pamba neighborhood. The most surprising thing, even after more than 380 years, is that it still flows with water. This water comes from sources originating in the Cerro de la M or the Three Crosses (unfortunately contaminated today by workshops and pipes).
This little stream developed alongside the nascent city, and it has seen its share of events throughout its history.
Popayán is blessed with its wonderful climate and geography. It has been concluded that our wonderful ""chorros,"" apart from responding to the artisanal provision of water and favored by this pleasant climate, consolidate a distinctly Roman concept. There is no more reliable vestige of a Roman fort than that of Popayán in the Americas. The Roman castrum, plural castra, meaning fortress, was a fortification or military encampment of the Roman Empire before the 1st century BC. Their encampments were always built according to a rectangular layout with two main crossing points: the ""Cardo Maximus,"" extending to the north and south, and the ""Decumanus Maximus"" to the east and west, dividing the countryside into four equal parts. The remaining streets and buildings were parallel to the main streets and formed a grid pattern.
The castrum was the basis of the model used by Spanish settlers in the Americas: the ""tablero"" (table of seven blocks) measuring 100 varas (80 meters) on each side, with a main square in the center near a river and a defensible hill. This followed strict rules imposed by the Spanish monarchy for the founding of new cities in the New World. With the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the Pubenza Valley, this concept of channeling and supplying water began to be implemented, both for private properties and public fountains, where people would go to collect the precious liquid.",4.0,To be part of the Colonial history of our white city.

Visiting Popayán's Historic Center is like opening a living history book. This charming neighborhood, also known as the White City, captivates from the first moment with its elegant colonial architecture, immaculate facades, and cobblestone streets that invite you to stroll leisurely.

Every corner of the center exudes culture and tradition. Ancient churches, such as San Francisco and La Ermita, impress with their beauty as well as their spiritual and historical significance. It's easy to lose track of time among museums, heritage mansions, and lively plazas.

One of the most remarkable aspects is the sense of peace the place conveys, perfect for those seeking to connect with history in a serene setting. Furthermore, the hospitality of its residents and the delicious local cuisine—such as pipián empanadas and champús—make a visit a memorable experience.

I would also like to highlight Dr. Mayerly who was attentive and offered in a very nice and kind way to help me resolve doubts and collaborate with me in the process in an agile and effective way.
Like the cleaning staff and those who served food with each entry, they made the moment pleasant with their emotional greeting and sincere smiles.

She prepare breakfast but it's optional, otherwise you still have a nice kitchen with a lot of space to store your food and open the whole time!
There is also laundry service or you can have the possibility to wash your own things and hang them!

I'll miss them!! Gracias!",4.0,Great hostal as we could also park our motorcycles inside. Super helpful. Clean kitchen and hot showers.,1.0,"My motorbike got stolen directly in front of the hostel at bright daylight, even though i was told it’s okay to park it there for a few hours as long as I later park it inside (didn’t want to block the hallway). The woman and staff - excluding the manager, see below - were very nice. But at the time of the theft the lady didn’t have data on her phone nor was there a landline. Finally managed to get the number of the Police who arrived 1 hour later and didn’t do much.

I was able to buy the motorbike back from the thieves a few days later… 🤨  >>The woman in the other review got it wrong, the negotiations were NOT done through  this hostel, as I checked out the next day and went to a hostel that seemed to have a better understanding of helping me with this matter.

Without the stolen motorbike I would have given 4 stars, nice little place, good beds. But this info given was dangerously careless. Later, by other people, I was later told this area has a very high crime rate, so stuff gets stolen there all the time. Met some Italians who got their earphones stolen the same day in a cafe in the same area.

**Edit, as reply to the owners reply:
1. I didn’t have any bags on the bike, they were all in my room. The installed case on my bike, yes. But that can’t be removed.
2. Saying that I left my bags on the bike highlights that you weren’t there yourself. If you weren’t there all the time, how can you call me a liar &  be so sure what the woman said and didn’t say?
3. If she had told me that it COULD be dangerous and there is a chance the bike can get stolen, I would have put the bike inside, which I had planned for when it was getting dark anyway, I didn’t want to block the reception with my bike in front of it
4. This guy has an extremely rude way of replying to negative reviews, check his other replies. Not a good tactic to receive more customers.
5. My motorbike was stolen. Do you want to argue about that too? I can give you the police report. Also, many people told me this is stuff happens a lot on this area. Had I known this, do you really think I would have left it outside? Correct, I wouldn’t have.
6. I live in Colombia for many years, also many years in Cali, which has a reputation of being very dangerous. I am not stupid and have travelled the world. I am street smart. Something like this would have NOT happened in Cali, not on broad daylight. Simple as that.

***Edit 2, again, read the other reactions of the manager to other critical reviews, zero ability to reflect and just lashes out. Poor employees. I have nothing more to say.

***Edit 3, there were videos? Why didn’t you tell that to the police when they were trying to find the thief. Super sketchy. Super rude. „Lying“? Daydreaming? It was 3 in the afternoon and I left it outside for 1 hour, your employee told me that it is okay to leave it there. Lying, again? Well, prove it! Sketchy dude. Don’t stay here!",Santa Teresa

Visiting Popayán's Historic Center is like opening a living history book. This charming neighborhood, also known as the White City, captivates from the first moment with its elegant colonial architecture, immaculate facades, and cobblestone streets that invite you to stroll leisurely.

Every corner of the center exudes culture and tradition. Ancient churches, such as San Francisco and La Ermita, impress with their beauty as well as their spiritual and historical significance. It's easy to lose track of time among museums, heritage mansions, and lively plazas.

One of the most remarkable aspects is the sense of peace the place conveys, perfect for those seeking to connect with history in a serene setting. Furthermore, the hospitality of its residents and the delicious local cuisine—such as pipián empanadas and champús—make a visit a memorable experience.

Popayán not only preserves its past, but also celebrates and shares it with pride.

This water comes from sources originating in the Cerro de la M or the Three Crosses (unfortunately contaminated today by workshops and pipes).
This little stream developed alongside the nascent city, and it has seen its share of events throughout its history.
Popayán is blessed with its wonderful climate and geography. It has been concluded that our wonderful ""chorros,"" apart from responding to the artisanal provision of water and favored by this pleasant climate, consolidate a distinctly Roman concept. There is no more reliable vestige of a Roman fort than that of Popayán in the Americas. The Roman castrum, plural castra, meaning fortress, was a fortification or military encampment of the Roman Empire before the 1st century BC. Their encampments were always built according to a rectangular layout with two main crossing points: the ""Cardo Maximus,"" extending to the north and south, and the ""Decumanus Maximus"" to the east and west, dividing the countryside into four equal parts. The remaining streets and buildings were parallel to the main streets and formed a grid pattern.
The castrum was the basis of the model used by Spanish settlers in the Americas: the ""tablero"" (table of seven blocks) measuring 100 varas (80 meters) on each side, with a main square in the center near a river and a defensible hill. This followed strict rules imposed by the Spanish monarchy for the founding of new cities in the New World.

We waited 29 minutes to be greeted and order. The host appeared bored and uninvolved, didn't greet us and pointed to empty table. Yes , we are gringos, but we have lived in Colombia for 22 years. The food took a full hour to arrive, and the beef ribs that I ordered were poorly cooked and serves in sort of sickly sweet and salty sauce that made them almost inedible .

We then ordered some famous ""mini chuletas vallunas"" with potatoes.

Visiting Popayán's Historic Center is like opening a living history book. This charming neighborhood, also known as the White City, captivates from the first moment with its elegant colonial architecture, immaculate facades, and cobblestone streets that invite you to stroll leisurely.

Every corner of the center exudes culture and tradition. Ancient churches, such as San Francisco and La Ermita, impress with their beauty as well as their spiritual and historical significance. It's easy to lose track of time among museums, heritage mansions, and lively plazas.

One of the most remarkable aspects is the sense of peace the place conveys, perfect for those seeking to connect with history in a serene setting. Furthermore, the hospitality of its residents and the delicious local cuisine—such as pipián empanadas and champús—make a visit a memorable experience.

Popayán not only preserves its past, but also celebrates and shares it with pride.

In the larger patio there are chairs and tables, a very pleasant spot to sit and relax. We also felt safe, as the entrance door is kept closed and opened by the staff only for guests.

It dates back to the 17th century and is located in the oldest neighborhood of Popayán, the La Pamba neighborhood. The most surprising thing, even after more than 380 years, is that it still flows with water. This water comes from sources originating in the Cerro de la M or the Three Crosses (unfortunately contaminated today by workshops and pipes).
This little stream developed alongside the nascent city, and it has seen its share of events throughout its history.
Popayán is blessed with its wonderful climate and geography. It has been concluded that our wonderful ""chorros,"" apart from responding to the artisanal provision of water and favored by this pleasant climate, consolidate a distinctly Roman concept. There is no more reliable vestige of a Roman fort than that of Popayán in the Americas. The Roman castrum, plural castra, meaning fortress, was a fortification or military encampment of the Roman Empire before the 1st century BC. Their encampments were always built according to a rectangular layout with two main crossing points: the ""Cardo Maximus,"" extending to the north and south, and the ""Decumanus Maximus"" to the east and west, dividing the countryside into four equal parts. The remaining streets and buildings were parallel to the main streets and formed a grid pattern.
The castrum was the basis of the model used by Spanish settlers in the Americas: the ""tablero"" (table of seven blocks) measuring 100 varas (80 meters) on each side, with a main square in the center near a river and a defensible hill. This followed strict rules imposed by the Spanish monarchy for the founding of new cities in the New World. With the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the Pubenza Valley, this concept of channeling and supplying water began to be implemented, both for private properties and public fountains, where people would go to collect the precious liquid.",4.0,To be part of the Colonial history of our white city.

We were happy with our good hiking boots, they’re not necessary but they’re helpful if it rained a lot (which it did in our case).",5.0,"This lookout provides a partial view of the city and a few wooden built shops, serving local delis and natural juices. The place is in overall general clean, except for a few dirty spots here and there.
Three Christian crosses mark the spot, as the name implies, and three benches provide a good place rest and a landscape view.
More enjoyable that the view, are the trails which lead to this lookout",3.0,"Some views are pretty and it's cool to be out of the city for a bit. But ALWAYS stay on the main paths where there are other people. We got mugged on an empty secondary path behind. I'm not saying it's common or uncommon there; but if it happened to us, it can happen to you. Just stay with the crowd.",4.0,Spectacular views across city and countryside. Good hike to site but a bit untidy. Can get good local food and sugar cane juice at the crosses. Well worth the hike.,

More enjoyable that the view, are the trails which lead to this lookout",3.0,"Some views are pretty and it's cool to be out of the city for a bit.

Good hike to site but a bit untidy. Can get good local food and sugar cane juice at the crosses. Well worth the hike.,

This mill stands out not only for its heritage value but also for its proximity to a Catholic religious institution, which has been an important spiritual and meeting center for the community for many years. The proximity of these two elements—the mill, which represents work and self-sufficiency, and the church, which symbolizes faith and social cohesion—creates a unique confluence of history, culture, and spirituality.

The combination of these sites offers an excellent opportunity to develop tourism and academic projects that highlight the cultural and social importance of Cimarronas. Visitors can appreciate how, over time, religious faith and agricultural activities have coexisted and intertwined in the daily lives of local communities. Preserving and promoting the mill and religious establishment will not only strengthen the identity of the area but also allow tourists and scholars to better understand the region's rich heritage.",,,,,,,,,Q547+X2

This ancient mill, which has stood the test of time, is a symbol of the culture and daily life of the Indigenous communities who have used it for generations to produce artisanal flour.

Situated next to a crystalline stream, the stone mill not only demonstrates the Yanacona's ingenious relationship with nature, but also represents a key element in their economic and cultural development. The stream's current was used to power the large stones that ground the grains into flour, essential for the community's diet.

This historic site, steeped in profound heritage value, offers visitors a unique opportunity to learn about ancestral wisdom and traditional food processing methods passed down from generation to generation. Beyond its practical function, the mill stands as a meeting place between the past and the present, ideal for tourism and academic projects that seek to highlight the cultural heritage of the Yanacona reservation.

Surrounded by a mountainous landscape and strategically located next to a ravine, this mill has been a symbol of the resilience and ingenuity of the inhabitants, who used it for the artisanal production of flour from local grains.

This mill stands out not only for its heritage value but also for its proximity to a Catholic religious institution, which has been an important spiritual and meeting center for the community for many years. The proximity of these two elements—the mill, which represents work and self-sufficiency, and the church, which symbolizes faith and social cohesion—creates a unique confluence of history, culture, and spirituality.

The combination of these sites offers an excellent opportunity to develop tourism and academic projects that highlight the cultural and social importance of Cimarronas. Visitors can appreciate how, over time, religious faith and agricultural activities have coexisted and intertwined in the daily lives of local communities. Preserving and promoting the mill and religious establishment will not only strengthen the identity of the area but also allow tourists and scholars to better understand the region's rich heritage.",,,,,,,,,Q547+X2

Surrounded by a mountainous landscape and strategically located next to a ravine, this mill has been a symbol of the resilience and ingenuity of the inhabitants, who used it for the artisanal production of flour from local grains.

This mill stands out not only for its heritage value but also for its proximity to a Catholic religious institution, which has been an important spiritual and meeting center for the community for many years. The proximity of these two elements—the mill, which represents work and self-sufficiency, and the church, which symbolizes faith and social cohesion—creates a unique confluence of history, culture, and spirituality.

The combination of these sites offers an excellent opportunity to develop tourism and academic projects that highlight the cultural and social importance of Cimarronas. Visitors can appreciate how, over time, religious faith and agricultural activities have coexisted and intertwined in the daily lives of local communities. Preserving and promoting the mill and religious establishment will not only strengthen the identity of the area but also allow tourists and scholars to better understand the region's rich heritage.",,,,,,,,,Q547+X2

This ancient mill, which has stood the test of time, is a symbol of the culture and daily life of the Indigenous communities who have used it for generations to produce artisanal flour.

Situated next to a crystalline stream, the stone mill not only demonstrates the Yanacona's ingenious relationship with nature, but also represents a key element in their economic and cultural development. The stream's current was used to power the large stones that ground the grains into flour, essential for the community's diet.

This historic site, steeped in profound heritage value, offers visitors a unique opportunity to learn about ancestral wisdom and traditional food processing methods passed down from generation to generation. Beyond its practical function, the mill stands as a meeting place between the past and the present, ideal for tourism and academic projects that seek to highlight the cultural heritage of the Yanacona reservation.

The recognition and preservation of this space will not only promote cultural tourism in the region but also encourage the study of traditional practices and their relevance in the current context, highlighting the intrinsic connection between the community and its natural environment.",,,,,,,,,P4HW+9F

In short, the beef and chicken rolls were so ground up that you couldn't even tell what kind of meat they were made of, and they didn't smell that good.

There are a couple of swimming pools, from the muddy one to scrub your body to the crystal clear water with small fishes eating your dead skin.
The landscape is also very beautiful, surrounded by mountains and waterfalls, the hot springs even have a small lake to go kayaking with swans and duck. There is also a couple of peacocks.
It's definitely a place to relax and enjoy the day!
Becarful if you are going low season, some pools can be close and there is no restaurant.",5.0,Awesome place. The waters are naturals. The water come from the Purace volcano. The entrance costs 22000 COP and you can access to many natural pools with many different temperatures. This place closes at 5 pm.,5.0,"The actual place is very beautiful. 3 different hot pools, a mud bath and a crystal clear pool with Garra Rufa fish.
My only wish is to magic away all the idiots that ruin the peace and tranquility by shouting, screaming and jumping in right in front of you with no respect for the nature of the place. Four guys were covering themselves in sunscreen and diving into the fish pool and the guard did nothing about them polluting it for the fish ☹️",4.0,"termales are open as of July 4, 2018, but my moto taxi told me that the owner is currently in negotiation with the indigenous community
this week and they may shut again. Highly
Recommend that you call the day of your visit to confirm that they are open.

The thermal springs offer changing rooms and lockers to store your belongings. Bring your own lock for free or rent one for 3,000 COP. The entrance is 18,000 COP. There is food to purchase at the restaurant, but it shut at 4pm. There are signs that say that outside food is prohibited, but at least when we came during the week, there were plenty of people bringing outside foods in. Not whole meals or picnics,
But definitely snacks, drinks, and beers.

At the very top is a more natural (and he coldest) spring with tiny fish that “bite” gently at your feet. Kind of like those crazy fish spas that people pay money to put their feet in haha.
There is a mud pool that is a bit far
From the rest of the polls as well as a concrete water slide. The slide is a little rough, and definitely varies with how fast the water is pumping out at the top. I did it once, but didn’t want it to ruin my bathing suit fabric and the drop off from the slide is quite shallow if you are going fast. On the other side of the slide are five or so more hot spring pools. The one st the very top is the hottest! That
One definitely felt like a real hot
Tub, While the others felt like varying ranges of bath water. As you move closer to the water
Source in the last pool, the water approaches pretty hot temperatures.

Overall, it cost 5,000 COP each way to get there on bus from popayan, 4,000 COP for the moto ride there, and 18,000 for the entry.  Not too expensive for a day of Soaking up the mountain air and  lazing about in some hot springs.

The changing room and bathrooms were well kept. The place wasn’t busy during the week. We were not able to get a moto taxi back, however. We got the number of our moto but the cell service was bad by the hot springs. Fortunately, we hailed the bus back to popayan from the side of the road. You might want to check if the bus from popayan will drop you at the springs directly to avoid the 4,000 COP moto ride there. Our bus driver told us to get off, but it might have just been because he thought we were going to the other hot springs. Ask your driver!",2.0,"Bit rundown, needs maintenance.

The cabins are very comfortable and have all the services, including hot water, which was wonderful in the cold climate of the place. It has parking for cars and motorcycles although it is not very spacious. The price is affordable, 120,000 per night per couple and includes entry to the Onix waterfall and boiling hot springs. In addition, the staff is very friendly and provided us with guidance and suggestions to enjoy our trip even more. Additionally, the place is located in a very quiet area, super close to the town of Coconuco (about 1 minute by car), but on the outskirts. It also has several hot springs very close. Boiling water is a 10 minute drive away. It is perfect to relax and get away from the noise and hustle and bustle of the cities. The road is in perfect condition and it is easy to get to. They do not have a restaurant but they do have alliances with some restaurants and offer a good variety of food at home, ranging from typical food to fast food. In the waterfall area they offer an aguapanela with cheese and bread for only 4 thousand pesos that is worth trying, 100% recommended.

Things to keep in mind:
- The weather is a little cold so you have to be prepared.
- To park cars you have to go up a fairly steep slope and there is not much space to turn the car around once up, so keep in mind that you have to take the car out in reverse.
- The cabin we stayed in has a triangle-shaped ceiling that starts to narrow from approximately 1 m high and the edges can be a little low for some people, especially in the area where the sink is. I had no problem, but my partner found it a little uncomfortable washing his hands, since he had to bend down a little - he is approximately 1.70.
- The shower curtain did not cover it completely and when showering it was very difficult not to wet a large part of the bathroom floor.
For everything else, we were very happy with the experience and the visit to this place 😊 It is definitely a place I would stay again!",5.0,"A very beautiful place, its owners are excellent, very friendly people, the facilities are very clean and tidy, everything is perfect, 100% recommended",

Entrance fee (as of July 2022) was 20,000 COP. Lockers cost 2,000 COP.

This place is run by the indigenous community, and they're doing an amazing job. The facilities are clean and plentiful, and there's an air of calm and respect. I went on a Sunday, when it was busy, and I didn't feel crowded or pressed at all.

There are 3 pools and a cold river, as well as cold showers. Two of the pools use natural rock formations as the basin. It's very relaxing and clean.

There is also a mud (lodo) pit, which you can access for free.

The mirada at the very top is incredibly beautiful.

For those coming from Popayán, it takes about 90 minutes. The bus leaves from Barrio Bolivar in Popayan (6500 COP) and goes to Coconuco. From there, you can take a moto or taxi (I was alone and took a moto for 10,000 COP each way. The same driver dropped me off and picked me up, per our arrangement.) Be advised that the last bus from Coconuco (at least on Sunday) is at 5:30 PM. People did tell me the springs are open 24 hrs, tho, which I'm not sure is correct.

It was an incredible day!",5.0,"Great secluded spot with warm and hot baths surrounded by the mountains.

During the weekend it’s a lot busier with buses coming in from the nearby towns.",5.0,"Really nice- not too crowded on a Tuesday. Pools were lovely and clean. Food was great. Don't forget to check out the waterfall!

The mud bath was low on mud (maybe we weren't trying hard enough?) and be sure you arrange to be picked up by your driver if you take a taxi from coconuco. (I don't think any taxis regularly service the area and no numbers were available to call).

Definitely recommend!",5.0,"Very friendly place! Beautiful.  And they really care about preserving the nature. It's not fancy. But if you want a quiet, chill, and rustic experience, it's amazing",5.0,"This place is so nice! There's a waterfall, a mud bath, and a few different hot pools. There owners are super sweet and the restaurant is good. There were not a lot of people when I was there and it's a very beautiful place!

I stayed the night in a cabin which was 60K.

It's on the route if you're travelling between San Augustin and Popayan. Or a good day trip from popayan :) from coconuco you can take a mototaxi to the springs.",

My only wish is to magic away all the idiots that ruin the peace and tranquility by shouting, screaming and jumping in right in front of you with no respect for the nature of the place. Four guys were covering themselves in sunscreen and diving into the fish pool and the guard did nothing about them polluting it for the fish ☹️",4.0,"termales are open as of July 4, 2018, but my moto taxi told me that the owner is currently in negotiation with the indigenous community
this week and they may shut again. Highly
Recommend that you call the day of your visit to confirm that they are open.

The thermal springs offer changing rooms and lockers to store your belongings. Bring your own lock for free or rent one for 3,000 COP. The entrance is 18,000 COP. There is food to purchase at the restaurant, but it shut at 4pm. There are signs that say that outside food is prohibited, but at least when we came during the week, there were plenty of people bringing outside foods in. Not whole meals or picnics,
But definitely snacks, drinks, and beers.

At the very top is a more natural (and he coldest) spring with tiny fish that “bite” gently at your feet. Kind of like those crazy fish spas that people pay money to put their feet in haha.
There is a mud pool that is a bit far
From the rest of the polls as well as a concrete water slide. The slide is a little rough, and definitely varies with how fast the water is pumping out at the top. I did it once, but didn’t want it to ruin my bathing suit fabric and the drop off from the slide is quite shallow if you are going fast. On the other side of the slide are five or so more hot spring pools. The one st the very top is the hottest! That
One definitely felt like a real hot
Tub, While the others felt like varying ranges of bath water. As you move closer to the water
Source in the last pool, the water approaches pretty hot temperatures.

Overall, it cost 5,000 COP each way to get there on bus from popayan, 4,000 COP for the moto ride there, and 18,000 for the entry.  Not too expensive for a day of Soaking up the mountain air and  lazing about in some hot springs.

The changing room and bathrooms were well kept. The place wasn’t busy during the week. We were not able to get a moto taxi back, however. We got the number of our moto but the cell service was bad by the hot springs. Fortunately, we hailed the bus back to popayan from the side of the road. You might want to check if the bus from popayan will drop you at the springs directly to avoid the 4,000 COP moto ride there. Our bus driver told us to get off, but it might have just been because he thought we were going to the other hot springs. Ask your driver!",2.0,"Bit rundown, needs maintenance. Value for money I found it very expensive. I would expect better service and better maintained facilities.",

Be aware, it is VERY COLD! I was not expecting to stay somewhere so cold in Colombia, so I was not prepared. The cabins are very rustic and provided no real protection nor insulation against the cold at night. It also didn't help that I slept with wet hair after a nighttime visit to the nearby hot springs. Overall, still worth a visit to this lovely area.",5.0,"Excellent place, very friendly hosts and always willing to meet your requirements, the food is delicious, the accommodation is very clean and pleasant, it is a magical place to hang out with friends and family, close to all the hot springs and the cabins have hot water hahaha without a doubt an added value taking into account the climatic conditions of the area, highly recommended.",5.0,"Good afternoon, who has the number where they answer the published one doesn't work?",5.0,"Excellent service. The cabins are very comfortable and have all the services, including hot water, which was wonderful in the cold climate of the place. It has parking for cars and motorcycles although it is not very spacious. The price is affordable, 120,000 per night per couple and includes entry to the Onix waterfall and boiling hot springs. In addition, the staff is very friendly and provided us with guidance and suggestions to enjoy our trip even more. Additionally, the place is located in a very quiet area, super close to the town of Coconuco (about 1 minute by car), but on the outskirts. It also has several hot springs very close. Boiling water is a 10 minute drive away. It is perfect to relax and get away from the noise and hustle and bustle of the cities. The road is in perfect condition and it is easy to get to. They do not have a restaurant but they do have alliances with some restaurants and offer a good variety of food at home, ranging from typical food to fast food. In the waterfall area they offer an aguapanela with cheese and bread for only 4 thousand pesos that is worth trying, 100% recommended.

Things to keep in mind:
- The weather is a little cold so you have to be prepared.
- To park cars you have to go up a fairly steep slope and there is not much space to turn the car around once up, so keep in mind that you have to take the car out in reverse.
- The cabin we stayed in has a triangle-shaped ceiling that starts to narrow from approximately 1 m high and the edges can be a little low for some people, especially in the area where the sink is. I had no problem, but my partner found it a little uncomfortable washing his hands, since he had to bend down a little - he is approximately 1.70.
- The shower curtain did not cover it completely and when showering it was very difficult not to wet a large part of the bathroom floor.
For everything else, we were very happy with the experience and the visit to this place 😊 It is definitely a place I would stay again!",5.0,"A very beautiful place, its owners are excellent, very friendly people, the facilities are very clean and tidy, everything is perfect, 100% recommended",

There are a couple of swimming pools, from the muddy one to scrub your body to the crystal clear water with small fishes eating your dead skin.
The landscape is also very beautiful, surrounded by mountains and waterfalls, the hot springs even have a small lake to go kayaking with swans and duck. There is also a couple of peacocks.
It's definitely a place to relax and enjoy the day!
Becarful if you are going low season, some pools can be close and there is no restaurant.",5.0,Awesome place. The waters are naturals. The water come from the Purace volcano. The entrance costs 22000 COP and you can access to many natural pools with many different temperatures. This place closes at 5 pm.,5.0,"The actual place is very beautiful. 3 different hot pools, a mud bath and a crystal clear pool with Garra Rufa fish.
My only wish is to magic away all the idiots that ruin the peace and tranquility by shouting, screaming and jumping in right in front of you with no respect for the nature of the place. Four guys were covering themselves in sunscreen and diving into the fish pool and the guard did nothing about them polluting it for the fish ☹️",4.0,"termales are open as of July 4, 2018, but my moto taxi told me that the owner is currently in negotiation with the indigenous community
this week and they may shut again. Highly
Recommend that you call the day of your visit to confirm that they are open.

The thermal springs offer changing rooms and lockers to store your belongings. Bring your own lock for free or rent one for 3,000 COP. The entrance is 18,000 COP. There is food to purchase at the restaurant, but it shut at 4pm. There are signs that say that outside food is prohibited, but at least when we came during the week, there were plenty of people bringing outside foods in. Not whole meals or picnics,
But definitely snacks, drinks, and beers.

At the very top is a more natural (and he coldest) spring with tiny fish that “bite” gently at your feet. Kind of like those crazy fish spas that people pay money to put their feet in haha.
There is a mud pool that is a bit far
From the rest of the polls as well as a concrete water slide. The slide is a little rough, and definitely varies with how fast the water is pumping out at the top. I did it once, but didn’t want it to ruin my bathing suit fabric and the drop off from the slide is quite shallow if you are going fast. On the other side of the slide are five or so more hot spring pools. The one st the very top is the hottest! That
One definitely felt like a real hot
Tub, While the others felt like varying ranges of bath water. As you move closer to the water
Source in the last pool, the water approaches pretty hot temperatures.

Overall, it cost 5,000 COP each way to get there on bus from popayan, 4,000 COP for the moto ride there, and 18,000 for the entry.  Not too expensive for a day of Soaking up the mountain air and  lazing about in some hot springs.

The changing room and bathrooms were well kept. The place wasn’t busy during the week. We were not able to get a moto taxi back, however. We got the number of our moto but the cell service was bad by the hot springs. Fortunately, we hailed the bus back to popayan from the side of the road. You might want to check if the bus from popayan will drop you at the springs directly to avoid the 4,000 COP moto ride there. Our bus driver told us to get off, but it might have just been because he thought we were going to the other hot springs. Ask your driver!",2.0,"Bit rundown, needs maintenance. Value for money I found it very expensive. I would expect better service and better maintained facilities.",

This was our 3rd visit. At 10pm there was no restaurant service but staff assisted us in boiling water for ramen. The cabins are basic. A few years back they had tvs. The sulfur ruined them we were told. The thermal springs are open 24 hours. Yet the area is quiet and you can be sure you’ll have a good night sleep. Its cold so pack accordingly. The sulfur smell is strong but you get accustomed to it. Beautiful when the sky is clear. Best star viewing. Road from popayan to the thermal springs has been paved so the trip is quicker. Definitely recommend.,4.0,Very nice place with hot springs but warning that the sulphur really smells. It's very hard to get it out of your hair and clothing. My swimming suit still sinks after multiple washings. The lunch is good too. There were a lot of locals when we went.,4.0,"Unique place with simple cottages directly at the spring with 24/7 access to the hot spring. At the time we visited the place, two water basins had not be filled. The hot spring experience is like Sauna in Europe and amazing!",5.0,"A great place to relax at a very decent price, only 20.000 pesos (as of Jan2K22).
There are several different pools of varying temperatures as well as a natural sauna. Mainly locals and there's a good restaurant too. To get here from Popayan, take a minibus from the bus station (1h, awesome scenery but rather bumpy) to the quaint little town of Coconuco and from there get a mototaxi to the thermal baths.
I fell in love with Coconuco,  the locals are so friendly and they are surrounded by mountains with lush vegetation which makes it out of this world. A must do trip when in Popayan!",3.0,"I heard it used to be better, but it was kinda run down and we left and went to aguatibido.",Unnamed Road

Entrance fee (as of July 2022) was 20,000 COP. Lockers cost 2,000 COP.

This place is run by the indigenous community, and they're doing an amazing job. The facilities are clean and plentiful, and there's an air of calm and respect. I went on a Sunday, when it was busy, and I didn't feel crowded or pressed at all.

There are 3 pools and a cold river, as well as cold showers. Two of the pools use natural rock formations as the basin. It's very relaxing and clean.

There is also a mud (lodo) pit, which you can access for free.

The mirada at the very top is incredibly beautiful.

For those coming from Popayán, it takes about 90 minutes. The bus leaves from Barrio Bolivar in Popayan (6500 COP) and goes to Coconuco. From there, you can take a moto or taxi (I was alone and took a moto for 10,000 COP each way. The same driver dropped me off and picked me up, per our arrangement.) Be advised that the last bus from Coconuco (at least on Sunday) is at 5:30 PM. People did tell me the springs are open 24 hrs, tho, which I'm not sure is correct.

For any extranjeros traveling through the Purace region, I highly recommend this local hot spot. It was an incredible day!",5.0,"Great secluded spot with warm and hot baths surrounded by the mountains. Includes a playground for kids and two restaurants (that don’t open until after noon and close by 5:30 pm). We could stay on the parking lot with our camper van and use the facilities. The road to get there is very rocky and slow going, but doable in 2WD car or van. During the weekend it’s a lot busier with buses coming in from the nearby towns.",5.0,"Really nice- not too crowded on a Tuesday. Pools were lovely and clean. Food was great. Don't forget to check out the waterfall!

The mud bath was low on mud (maybe we weren't trying hard enough?) and be sure you arrange to be picked up by your driver if you take a taxi from coconuco. (I don't think any taxis regularly service the area and no numbers were available to call).

Definitely recommend!",5.0,"Very friendly place! Beautiful.  And they really care about preserving the nature. It's not fancy. But if you want a quiet, chill, and rustic experience, it's amazing",5.0,"This place is so nice! There's a waterfall, a mud bath, and a few different hot pools. There owners are super sweet and the restaurant is good. There were not a lot of people when I was there and it's a very beautiful place!

I stayed the night in a cabin which was 60K.

It's on the route if you're travelling between San Augustin and Popayan. Or a good day trip from popayan :) from coconuco you can take a mototaxi to the springs.",
